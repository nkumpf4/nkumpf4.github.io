                As I was first designing my site, I stumbled upon tons of simple animation galleries, complete with
                CSS/HTML snippets that you could copy and paste into your design. One of these was a simple underline
                animation when you hover over text that I thought was pretty sweet. (Feel free to check out <a
                    href="https://cssfx.dev/">CSSFX</a>, they have a lot of great animations). I quickly added it in to
                my own site, and didn't give it much more thought.
            </p>
            <p>
                A while later, I read a cool post from <a
                    href="https://tobiasahlin.com/blog/css-trick-animating-link-underlines/">Tobias Ahlin</a> about
                creating this same effect using pseudo-classes. I liked this solution a lot more, because it kept the
                HTML markup minimal and all the styling was done in CSS, which was just way cleaner. I'd recommend
                checking his post out cause it's a super good example, and is what led me to experimenting with this in
                the first place.
            </p>
            <h1>Why Pseudo-classes?</h1>
            <p>
                All of this made me want to learn a little more about pseudo-classes. I'm not big on using code I don't
                understand, so I got to googling. Pseudo-classes are used to interact with elements that are in a
                certain state. Most are familiar with <code>:visited</code> or <code>:hover</code>, which are
                pseudo-classes used in almost every website to style links. Other sites might use
                <code>:first-child</code> to adjust the margins on the first element in a container. In general,
                pseudo-classes allow you to be more specific with your styling.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are also pseudo-elements (the ones with the double colon), which are a related concept and are used
                similarly, albeit there are some technical differences. While pseudo-classes help you select elements
                that are in a specific state, pseudo-elements "add" new virtual elements that didn't exist before. This
                nuance is actually what makes our animations possible, so I figured it was worth mentioning.
            </p>
            <p>
                We're primarily interested in <code>::before</code> and <code>::after</code>. Both of these have a
                <code>content</code> property which, as you could guess, indicates the content of our
                pseudo-element. This is how we define what should be added to our page. For example, you might use
                <code>::before</code> and <code>content: url('img.jpg')</code> to add an image before every heading. Or
                you might use it in order to add some fancy styled quotation marks to each of your quotes. The important
                thing is that it doesn't require any added HTML.

        <div class="text-wrapper">
            <p>
                This is why Tobias Ahlin's solution was so great! Instead of needing to add a <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>
                before everything we want to underline, we can just modify <code>::before</code> so that it adds it in
                for us. Simply set <code>content: ""</code>, adjust the size and positioning, and you're good to go.
                Again go check out his post <a
                    href="https://tobiasahlin.com/blog/css-trick-animating-link-underlines/">here</a> to see all of this
                in action.

            <p>
                At this point I was pretty stoked, and wanted to see how else I could use this. So I went on to try and
                use it for an animation outlining my input boxes. This was another one I picked up from <a
                    href="https://cssfx.dev/">CSSFX</a>, but their solution required adding four
                <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> tags for every input box. (The perfect chance to cut down on some HTML that
                was purely there for style). Unfortunately I ran into some limitations.
            </p>
            <h1>The Problems</h1>
            <p>
                1) The main issue was that because <code>::before</code> and <code>::after</code> add content to an
                element, they can only be used on container elements, such as a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>. You can't add
                anything "before" or "after" something's contents if it doesn't have any. In our case
                <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> is not a container element.
            </p>
            <p>
                2) The second problem was that <code>::before</code> and <code>::after</code> are the only
                pseudo-elements that have the <code>content</code> property, meaning I had to replace all four outlines
                using two elements.
            </p>
            <p>
                Luckily these problems weren't too difficult to solve. From what I could tell, the only way around the
                first issue was to add in a container element to use for the styling. This wasn't ideal, but it was much
                cleaner than four spans, and still kept the semantics of the input tags. As for there only being two
                elements to work with, I realized that the top and bottom borders could be animated together, as well as
                the left and right. In the end, this is simply a limitation of pseudo-elements, but with some
                creativity, you should be able to get around almost any problems you have.

        </div>
        <div class="text-wrapper">
            <p>Here's a working example.</p>

            <p>
                There are some important things to note about this implementation. As you can see, each input box gets
                it's own container. Make sure you set <code>display: inline-block;</code> or else you'll end up with
                outlines that are going across the entire page. You'll need to include <code>box-sizing:
                    border-box;</code> in order for the borders to line up correctly. Also, as in Tobias's
                example, we include <code>visibility: hidden;</code> for browsers that don't support CSS animations.
                Finally, we make use of the <code>:focus-within</code> pseudo-class in order to animate our outline.
                This is because focus goes on the input element when selected, and not on our container element. It's
                also worth mentioning that you can chain pseudo-class selectors just like you would with normal classes.
            </p>


            <p>People have gotten pretty creative with <code>:before</code> and <code>:after</code>, and I think they
                can be pretty powerful tools once you better understand how they work.</p>
